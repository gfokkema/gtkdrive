gtkdrive
========
This is an attempt to bring Google Drive to GTK+ 3.0.

While I will try to make this a full fledged GDrive client,
this is also an attempt at learning C++.

!!THERE WILL BE NO GUARANTEES!!

Features that this program should implement:
- Synchronization with Google Drive
- A minimal GUI (settings dialog?)
- Minimization to tray
- Progress tracker
- (Possibly) user switching / multiple accounts

That is all for now! :)
